       "69      $TSLA You all should do your research on Tesla before investing. A lot of people are saying this is not a car company. 95% of their revenue comes from auto sales. That&#39;s auto sales, leasing and other related. 5% energy storage. Tesla are high price EV&#39;s and they only sell 380 thousand per year. Toyota sells 11 million VW sells 11 million this is each. Ford sells 2 times as many F150 trucks in the United States then Tesla sells autos in the world. Sorry to inform all you investors, but there isn&#39;t a Santa Claus. And Space X is not part of Tesla. Yet the valuation of Tesla is more than all three of these behemoth automakers put together! The valuation is 10 years down the road for Tesla and people are paying today for a valuation in the future by 10 years. Lots could happen in 10 years, there&#39;s also lots of competition every automaker makes EVs Plus have a variety of other options. There&#39;s tons in new EV makers. Panasonic makes Tesla&#39;s batteries.                                                   \n",

       "75      $TSLA ‚ÄúTesla CEO Elon Musk tweeted Friday that Tesla‚Äôs stock price is ‚Äútoo high imo,‚Äù This tweet was back in May. Not much as happened since then, they didn&#39;t get into the S&amp;P 500 which was the big deal! So please don&#39;t blame your fearless leader if the stock crashes! It&#39;s gone up 400% since then and Elon must be saying enough is enough to himself. He knows this just will start a crash. Tesla is priced for possibly 10 years down the road. There‚Äôs huge competition lots of really good EV‚Äòs. The only thing the competition has the Tesla doesn‚Äôt there‚Äôs a whole line of vehicles trucks and so on. Toyota and Tesla batteries are built by Panisonic. Toyota has autonomous and they sell 11 million vehicles a year. Tesla sells 400,000 if they‚Äôre lucky end it will take 10 years in a lot of factories to build 11 million Tesla it is worth twice what Toyota Is worth. What is wrong with this picture? Also assuming everybody&#39;s going to want an expensive EV to drive.                                                   \n",

Everything going in Tesla&#39;s favor with several new factories in the planning stage in less than five years Tesla&#39;s earnings may be 50% behind these four companies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

Actually Panasonic supplies most everything for Tesla batteries and also Toyota batteries. So what&#39;s proprietary about anything that&#39;s going to be said on BATTERY DAY??? 1,000,000 miles, how many people are going to be driving 1,000,000 miles on their current car? I think they should make a 200,000 mile battery that self-destructs and turns into dust. that doesn&#39;t have to go into the landfill right at 200,000 miles.

If they were to make an acquisition, now would be the time to do it. - Apple and Peloton both have investor conferences on Tuesday as well.. this is where people are thinking it could be announced. - Now, this is obviously not super likely to happen, but the chance is there. - $PTON should run heavy on hype Monday through tuesday morning leading into the conference. - I personally plan to swing $PTON through tuesday morning, and will probably take profit tuesday pre-conference. - With my trading strategy, i secure profits on rumors, as usually the rumors don‚Äôt go into fruition. Either way, rumors are everywhere, people are excited, and $PTON just absolutely killed earnings. - $PTON sitting on a 42% short float as well.

       "407     $SPAQ I wish you guys the best of luck. Soon it&#39;ll be $FISK but I think the two EV stocks that will prosper is $DPHC / $WKHS and $NIO . Workhorse for the immense opportunity of not only building the next fleet of USPS cars but perhaps UPS, DHL and FedEx contracts will follow as well. The future is electric and the burning of fossil fuels will be less common for companies like this. $NIO has a large advantage over other EV companies as its already sold more vehicles in China year over year and have the same issues tesla had which was having high demand but not enough to fulfill orders. Fuck Chinese stocks but I was wrong about $BABA and I&#39;m willing to take a gamble with $NIO with the promising future it shows and humbling CEO.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "408     $JD This has to be the most frustrating put scalp. I just knew it would test $70, so I played the 9/18 $75 and $70 puts only to make 30% and 37% on each trade.

       "433     $JD $BABA $BIDU im not hearing it talked about a lot but I think a Biden Presidency really helps the China Tech cohort. He will try to patch up relations with China and will be pro-tech in general.

       "448     $BABA I‚Äôd say right now there‚Äôre only two groups of people left in the market, the extremely greedy who try to ‚Äúbuy the bottom‚Äù and the extremely fearful who‚Äôs panic selling everything they used to believed in. Until the market settles down with the middle range of investors back, we might not be able to trade this stock on fundamentals and good performances only. But my long term target remains the same, BABA is still on track of 300 before 2021, no drop could change that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "449     $BABA I might be too optimistic here and paid the tuition. The market needs a correction from the insane run in August, but BABA was already undervalued then and was playing the catch up game instead of being a bubble like FAANGs. However, market crash this big causes irrationality, under which we no longer performs basing on fundamentals.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

       "598     $BTC.X You have to realize what not closing the 9600 gap means. It means there&#39;s no going back. It puts the fear of God into anyone who doesn&#39;t already have a position. It tells people Bitcoin is wild, and off the chain, and it can&#39;t be held down. As opposed to people thinking that they can always wait, and they should never buy so long as there is a gap.

Truth is NO ONE knows what anything is going to do. You make guesses and then pat yourselves on the back when you&#39;re correct and it&#39;s rare, because it&#39;s just that, a guess. Y&#39;all said this would die when it broke $100. Bitcoin is a 30+ year hold. You spend way too much time analyzing day to day trends. That&#39;s retarded.

       "794     $TWTR There is one piece of the Market that must NOT be over looked: There are More People Buying Stocks Now Than There Ever Have Been In the History of the Stock Market! In the Beginning these New Investors started purchasing the Popular Stocks making them Very Expensive! Now They Have Began to Educate themselves and realize they need to invest in the Under Valued Stocks Like TWTR, Energy, and maybe even banks. This is why the more expensive stocks have began to Fall and the under valued ones are holding strong and will begin to climb Higher!

       "936     $MSFT today my dad asked me to help him link data between two excel worksheets in his companies onedrive. I managed to sync data from an online excel file by mapping the sharepoint folder to his computer. The problem is, this only works for him, when editing using the desktop version. This isnt feasible, since you can no longer use the online editor. So the entire company would have to map the sharepoint folder, and stick to the desktop editor. Wtf Microsoft, people have been asking for this feature since 2014. $GOOG sheets had this functionality from its inception so i figured that of course the company that built Excel would also support it, jesus christ!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

       "961     $JD Was reading a NY times bestseller business strategy book on the Big 4 ($AMZN, $FB, $GOOG , $AAPL ). The biggest takeaway was that Amazon‚Äôs scale and warehousing capabilities give it the power to take out any of the regular retailers/competitors when it comes to e-commerce. Additionally, it isn‚Äôt actually the e-commerce that makes Amazon the juggernaut it is, it‚Äôs the rapidly growing high margin AWS, the subscriptions from Prime and its superior customer service that give it the undisputed king crown. There are a few very important lessons there for JD. It has gotten a lot of things right already when it comes to infrastructure build out. If it can continue to revolve its business model, it‚Äôll be well on its way to dominate the massive Chinese e-commerce market even more than amazon did in the US.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",

       "1464    $AMZN is being beaten down solely for one reason, it is being wrongfully placed in the same basket as the two over hyped over bought &quot;splitters&quot; Apple and Tesla. This is further proof of just how much the market today is played by young amateurs .Clueless about fundamentals, they just play the ticker, and swing with the masses under the plug gets removed! Many wish Amazon would announce a stock split and play the same game, personally I prefer they don&#39;t. It would pop up the share price, no doubt, but in turn would just bring in weak hands, young amateurs, playing a pyramid scheme.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

       "1740    $NKLA This guy Trevor is a joke. I would love to invest in this company but definitely when the price will be around $20 with a new CEO. He has to be fired. The company is not doing what they have been saying (no real technology) but they are assembling part of great manufacturers to buil the Truck of zero emissions. That&#39;s smart but the way they lied is not smart at all. I think they can sell aot of those trucks in the future, the badger also. But investor are very disappointed so the price will fall down. Deserve to buy around $20 when the fear will stop. Be careful long, they are many many short right now. I&#39;m gonna enter around $20...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

Fisker is the future in EV!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

Keep an eye on DMYT GMHI and FEAC as the next spacs if u missed the first three.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
